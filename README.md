# 📊 Task 6: Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations

This project involves analyzing monthly **sales revenue** and **order volume** using SQL with the `Sales_DataSet.csv` dataset.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **SQLite**
- **DB Browser for SQLite**
- **SQL**

---

## 📁 Dataset Description

- `Order Date`: The date an order was placed (original format: MM/DD/YYYY)
- `Sales`: The revenue generated by a transaction
- `Order ID`: Unique identifier for each order

---

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze monthly trends using aggregation functions such as:
- `SUM()` for total monthly revenue
- `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)` for total monthly order volume

---

## ✅ Tasks Completed

1. **Converted date format** from MM/DD/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD for compatibility with SQLite date functions.
2. Used `strftime()` to extract **year** and **month**.
3. Grouped data by year and month to compute:
   - Total sales revenue per month
   - Number of unique orders per month
4. Filtered results to only show **2016–2017**.
5. Ordered the results chronologically using `ORDER BY`.
